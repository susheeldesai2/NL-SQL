GenAI-powered Chatbot for CSV to SQLite Conversion and SQL Querying

This GenAI chatbot is designed to convert a static CSV file into structured tables, which are then stored in an SQLite database. Once the data is stored, users can interact with the chatbot by asking questions in natural language. The chatbot is capable of processing these queries and translating them into SQL statements, which are executed on the underlying SQLite database. The results of the SQL query are then returned to the user in a clear, comprehensible format.

Key Features:

CSV to SQLite Conversion: The chatbot automatically reads and processes the static CSV file, converting its contents into tables stored within an SQLite database for efficient querying and management.

Natural Language Querying: Users can ask questions in everyday language, making it easy to retrieve information without needing to understand SQL syntax. The chatbot intelligently interprets these queries and translates them into valid SQL commands.

SQL Query Execution and Results: Once the query is generated, the chatbot executes the SQL command on the SQLite database and presents the results to the user in a structured format.

Static Data: The CSV file remains static, meaning it doesnâ€™t change over time. The chatbot can be used for consistent querying of this dataset.

This solution allows users to easily access and retrieve data from a CSV-based dataset through a conversational interface, making data interaction more accessible and user-friendly.
